Inefficient claims processing for the insurer meant that customer experience was suffering and people were losing faith in their insurance policies. The average insurance customer was having to wait over 25 days to receive an outcome on their claim, often in times of vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The barriers to rapid claims settlement were clear; understanding of unstructured data, complexity and volume of decision making, legacy systems and processes.</p>\n<p>Sprout.ai’s patented claims automation platform solves these challenges, and has already delivered instant claims settlement on millions of insurance claims around the world.

58	<p>LawnStarter is the nation’s leading on-demand marketplace for lawn care and related services, crossing $100M in bookings last year. And lawn care is only the beginning - our vision is to become the one-stop shop for all home services.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>Design Director</strong></h3>\n<p>As a Design Director at LawnStarter, you will be leading our path to a 5-star customer experience. This is a position with high autonomy in which you will set the vision and processes related to our user research, branding, product design. With a current small team of 4 members, you will need to be able to navigate between strategic decision making, people management, and operational work. This is a high leverage role, with exposure to our entire leadership team and responsibility to drive results.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>Problems to be solved</strong></h3>\n<p>Your main responsibility will be to improve our customer experience,collaborating to ensure we are providing great solutions to the right problems. In order to do that, you will need to prioritize and solve challenges, which we have plenty of, such as:</p>\n<p><strong>Design as a value driver</strong>: We are a technology company that partners with local pros to deliver local services. This means a great user experience depends on UI design but also on service design, incentives design, and so much more. It’s an intricate business and every detail has ripple effects that are often hard to predict and even harder without great design practices and product taste. We are also a small team, with just 4 designers (your team), to cover a lot of surface area. How can we set a high bar for what’s a great user experience? How can we get every designer and every initiative to hit that bar? How can we do that while moving fast? What tools, processes, libraries, AI workflows, etc, can we leverage in order to move faster and better?</p>\n<p><strong>Understand customers and pros</strong>: We believe delighting consumers starts with deeply understanding them. Currently, we have spread out efforts to understand our customers across the organization, with no central repository or method to institutionalize learnings. How can we systematize learning about our customers and pros? How can we ensure that interviews, surveys, and other research methods are being applied with best practices in mind?</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-brand strategy</strong>: We currently own three brands - LawnStarter, Lawn Love, and HomeGnome, and might not stop there. This allows us to increase our marketing reach while offering slightly different versions of the same product. How do we ensure alignment between what we market, how we present it, and what we deliver, for each brand? How do we ensure a good balance between brands complementing each other while not competing too much with each other? Customers can feel when a brand is not well rounded, with promises that don’t match delivery, and it impacts retention, referrals and overall image.</p>\n<p><strong>Experience</strong>: You have 7+ years of experience in design at technology companies and at least a few years of leadership experience. Bonus if you have a diverse design experience w/ product and service design, and user research.</p>\n<p><strong>Team builder:</strong> You are ready to lead and develop exceptional people, helping them be their best selves. You create an environment where people are excited about achieving more each day, with intellectual honesty and trust across the team.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Mindset: </strong>You take pride in understanding problems deeply and asking the right questions. You can absorb a variety of topics with extreme ease, having a structured and logical approach to developing your understanding of the business and its challenges. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you have a preconceived system of processes and methods and plan on just applying them without first learning all the ways our business is unique.</p>\n<p><strong>Excellence:</strong> You set extremely high standards for yourself and others around you. When you say something is getting done, the team can trust you. You don’t tolerate mediocrity, but you also dedicate your time to helping others evolve and learn so that the team can operate at a higher level. You also understand that often true differentiation only comes from executing well on very hard things, so you don’t shy away from challenges. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you don’t have a track record of impressive performance.</p>\n<p><strong>User focus:</strong> You care deeply about understanding the user you are designing for and use a mix of user research techniques to gather that understanding. You are not afraid of talking to users, launching surveys, or looking at behavioural data.</p>\n<p><strong>Bias for action: </strong>You understand that in spite of the careful approach you take to understanding problems and identifying opportunities, you actively try not to be perfectionist or get yourself tied up in knots. You have a bias for action in order to make progress. You enjoy being scrappy and constraints enthrall you. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you, by default, like building complete and full solutions from the get go.</p>\n<p><strong>Salary Range</strong>: 160K-200K USD annually</p>\n<p><strong>Healthcare benefits: </strong>Medical, dental, and vision</p>\n<p><strong>Skin in the game: </strong>We believe great leaders should share in the success they help create. As a Design Director, you'll have meaningful equity in the company, giving you real upside as we scale. We want you invested—not just in your work, but in the future we’re building together.</p>\n<p><strong>Fully remote position:</strong> Work remotely from anywhere you want.</p>\n<p><strong>Unlimited PTO: </strong>We focus on results. Take the time you need to recharge or enjoy life, work hard when you are back.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong></em></p>\n<p>LawnStarter provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetics. In addition to federal law requirements, LawnStarter complies with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the company has facilities.

213	<div>\n <p>The climate crisis is the defining challenge of our time—but it’s also the greatest opportunity for innovation, and a challenge we’re proud to take on. At Overstory, we’re harnessing cutting-edge technology to enable a resilient electrical grid that keeps communities thriving as our world changes.</p>\n <p>The grid is the backbone of life as we know it. It powers hospitals, keeps food fresh, and ensures communities stay connected. But extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and growing wildfire risks are putting this critical system under pressure. All of this combined makes the electric utility industry the greatest opportunity for tackling climate change.</p>\n <p>One of the leading causes of catastrophic wildfires and power outages? Trees and brush coming into contact with power lines.</p>\n <p>That’s where we help. At Overstory, we use AI and advanced satellite imagery to pinpoint and prioritize vegetation risks before they materialize. By giving utilities critical analysis on those risks, we’re helping prevent outages, reduce wildfire risks, and accelerate the transition to a safer, more resilient grid.</p>\n <p>Our team spans the Americas and Europe, and we work with utility partners across the Americas and beyond. We’re outdoor enthusiasts, musicians, artists, athletes, parents, and adventurers—15 nationalities strong and growing.

248	<p>Freight forwarding is a $200B+ industry you might not know about, but it’s the backbone of the global economy, ensuring goods move seamlessly around the world. Freight forwarders—like DHL, FedEx, and UPS—act as “travel agents” for goods, managing the complex operations that keep supply chains running.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, this critical industry remains largely untouched by modern software, with many processes still managed manually or through outdated systems. The eco-system is so fragile that one missed email can disrupt an entire shipment, leading to delays, poor service, and financial losses.</p>\n<p>At Raft, we’re building an AI platform to automate freight operations. From auditing invoices and preparing customs filings to syncing information across systems, we empower operators to work more efficiently and accurately. The impact?

285	<p>We built Bubble with a clear mission in mind: to empower everyone to create software. We believe anyone with an idea should be able to build it, so we’re making software creation accessible to everyone. Our AI visual development platform enables anyone, whether they’re first-time entrepreneurs or enterprise teams, to take an idea from prompt to fully-functional, scalable reality across web, iOS, and Android — all on one platform, all without writing or managing a single line of code.\n <br>\n <br>\n As the only full-stack, cross-device no-code platform on the market with over 5 million users in over 100 countries, Bubble is breaking down the barriers to entrepreneurship and innovation across the globe.</p>\n<p><strong>What we’ve achieved:</strong></p>\n<p>Our product is working, and we are thriving. Entire VC-backed companies have been built entirely on Bubble. After finding product market fit and 8 years of bootstrapping, we raised a $100 million Series A and we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in the New York tech ecosystem.\n <br>\n <br>\n You can <a href="https://bubble.io/app-gallery" rel="noopener noreferrer">build just about anything</a> on Bubble - and our community is living proof. More than just launching products, people are turning their ideas into real businesses. <a href="https://bubble.io/showcase/mailead" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailead</a> grew a $10k investment in a Bubble product into a $2M valuation, while <a href="https://bubble.io/showcase/faceless-video" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Faceless.video</a> went from 0 to $1M+ ARR in less than a year, among <a href="https://bubble.io/showcase" rel="noopener noreferrer">many other examples</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>About the team: \n  <br></strong>The Core Blue team consists of 9 Engineers, one Engineering Manager, and one Product Designer, focused on our visual editor and expanding the Bubble language feature set. The editor is where users actually build their apps - from designing the UI on a WYSIWYG canvas, to writing the business logic and user flows, to defining the database structures. It is the very heart and core of the entire Bubble experience! You can think of the Bubble Editor as a combined IDE and programming language in the traditional web development sense. Using this analogy, you will own the visual programming language scope.</p>\n<p><strong>About the role:</strong></p>\n<p>As a Senior Product Manager on the Blue team, you'll drive improvements to our editor and to the Bubble language, to ensure that anyone can quickly build the application they need without having to think in coding terms. You’ll ensure these new features accompany our AI efforts, in particular our bot-driven conversational editing.</p>\n<p>Because anything is possible with code, the two big (and fun!) existential questions you’ll be wrestling with are:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>How do you create a visual programming language that is every bit as expressive as code yet way easier to understand and use for technical &amp; non-technical users alike?</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>How do you empower users to create highly customized behaviors in their application, using logic, connecting to external services, and leveraging AI?</p>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>In this role, you'll:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>Own and drive product roadmap for our Core - Blue pod, that focuses on the editor and the Bubble language</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Partner closely with engineering, research, and design in order to collectively work towards improvement</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Establish strategic initiatives and metrics into well defined product deliverables, tasks with timelines.</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Lead user research efforts early in the exploration phase, not just for validation</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Actively listen to and incorporate user feedback throughout the development process</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Develop and document clear product specifications to enable efficient cross-team collaboration</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Make tough prioritization calls with incomplete information while maintaining high standards</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Get hands-on with Bubble to deeply understand our platform within your first 60 days</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Mentor and support other Product Managers to establish product management best practices</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Lead product initiatives from concept through delivery, balancing long-term vision with near-term execution.</p>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>About you:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>5+ years of product management experience shipping complex technical products</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Strong product sense - you can identify high-ROI opportunities and translate them into concrete solutions with clear, actionable steps</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Experience collaborating effectively with engineering teams on technical implementation decisions</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Experience using research and data to inform product decisions, not just validate them</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Strong documentation and communication skills for working with cross-functional teams</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Proficient in Bubble already, or excited about becoming an expert-level Bubble developer quickly</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Humble team player, willing to roll up your sleeves and do the work</p>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p>\n<p>We offer competitive compensation aligned to tier one markets. Our estimated salary for this role at Bubble ranges from $145,000 to $190,000. Actual pay is determined by multiple factors such as skills, qualifications, experience and market demand.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to cash and equity compensation, Bubble offers a robust benefits package equating to roughly twenty thousand in additional annual compensation:</p>\n<p>Our benefits include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>Comprehensive health coverage</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>401(k) matching</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Wellness and work enablement stipends</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>Flexible PTO</p>\n </li>\n <li>\n  <p>A Sabbatical program</p>\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>\n<p>For this role, Bubble is currently only considering candidates who are authorized to work in the US and are within the New York City metro area.</p>\n<p><em>We prefer hiring people within commuting distance of our NYC office because we value getting together in person regularly. For those who enjoy working from our Manhattan office on a more regular basis, we offer catered lunches, and happy hours, among other fun perks.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Join us!</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s democratize access to technology together!

Our aim is to solve the world’s most urgent and complex access challenges by building, manufacturing, and operating the first instant delivery and logistics system that serves all humans equally, wherever they are. From powering Rwanda’s national blood delivery network and Ghana’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution, to providing on-demand home delivery for Walmart, to enabling healthcare providers to bring care directly to U.S. homes, we are transforming the way things move for businesses, governments, and consumers.</p>\n<p>The technology is complex but the idea is simple: a teleportation service that delivers what you need, when you need it. Through our technology—including robotics and autonomy—we are decarbonizing delivery, decreasing road congestion, and reducing fossil fuel consumption and air pollution, while providing equitable access to billions of people and building a more resilient global supply chain.</p>\n<p>Join Zipline and help us deliver on our promise to build a more equitable and resilient global supply chain.</p>\n<h3><strong>About You and The Role </strong></h3>\n<p>Zipline’s P1 platform—the company’s first-generation long-range autonomous drone system—is already delivering millions of medical products across Africa. As we continue to scale our P1 system globally, the hardware and infrastructure supporting it must evolve and expand.

People want flexibility, meaning, and connection. At <a href="http://www.kadence.co/">Kadence</a>, we’re building the operating system for hybrid work, helping organisations coordinate people, places, and projects so everyone can do their best work, wherever they are.</p>\n   <p>Our mission is to help every organisation unlock the full potential of its people through smarter coordination of workplaces, schedules, and teams. From intelligent <a href="https://kadence.co/space-management/">space management</a> and real-time <a href="https://kadence.co/workplace-analytics/">workplace analytics</a>, to seamless <a href="https://kadence.co/people-coordination/">team coordination</a>, <a href="https://kadence.co/hybrid-workplace-ai/">AI assistants</a> and meaningful <a href="https://kadence.co/workplace-events/">workplace events</a>, Kadence helps companies create environments where work flows and people thrive.</p>\n   <p>Backed by world-class investors and trusted by over 500 organisations, Kadence is growing fast. With established teams in Belfast, London, San Francisco and Salt Lake City, we’re just getting started. If you’re excited by mission-driven impact, big ideas, and helping define the future of work – join us.\n    <br></p>\n   <p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL DO</strong>\n    <br></p>\n   <ul>\n    • <strong>AI product strategy:</strong> Define the vision and roadmap for AI-first capabilities such as AI-powered collaborative planning, workspace optimisation, predictive scheduling, and intelligent assistants. You will use deep customer, market, and technical insights to guide this work. Your focus will be on redesigning planning and coordination workflows with AI at the centre, so every in-person interaction has the right context, environment, and team setup.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>AI-native workflow reimagination</strong>: Rethink how users approach hybrid work coordination. Use AI to transform tasks like scheduling, space booking, and team rituals into smart, adaptive flows that eliminate friction and respond intelligently to user behaviour.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>Cross-functional execution</strong>: Lead product development from discovery through launch. Work closely with engineering, ML, design, and go-to-market teams. You will define data requirements, shape architecture and UX, and track product performance through clear metrics.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>Go-to-market and monetisation:</strong> Develop pricing and packaging strategies for AI features. Test business models and validate product-market fit. You will own the commercial success of your product areas.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>Data-driven learning loops</strong>: Create feedback systems that capture user behavior, AI performance, and commercial outcomes. Use this data to run experiments, improve models, and refine user experiences.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>Customer and internal enablement</strong>: Engage directly with early users and create internal tools, documentation, and narratives that help support, success, and sales teams deliver value with AI features.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>Governance and trust</strong>: Embed responsible AI practices into everything you build. Balance automation with user control, design for transparency, and ensure compliance with relevant policies.\n   </ul>\n   <ul>\n    <br>\n   </ul>\n   <p><strong>WHAT YOU BRING</strong></p>\n   <ul>\n    <li><strong>AI product experience</strong>: You have significant product management experience, including meaningful work on AI or ML-powered features. You’ve built user-facing tools that use machine learning, especially in scheduling, coordination, or productivity software.</li>\n    • <strong>Technical fluency</strong>: You are comfortable with concepts like embeddings, intent detection, prompt design, and data pipelines. You don’t need to code, but you understand enough to speak with engineers and data scientists with confidence.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>Workflow thinking</strong>: You’re passionate about redesigning everyday tasks to make them easier, faster, or disappear entirely. You love turning messy, manual processes into smooth, intelligent flows.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>User and business focus</strong>: You combine customer empathy with commercial thinking. You’ve developed monetisation strategies, tested usage-based pricing, and tied product outcomes to real business results.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>Influence through clarity:</strong> You lead by making smart, clear arguments backed by evidence. You work well with engineers, designers, and executives alike.\n    <br>\n    • <strong>Execution mindset:</strong> You iterate quickly, ship efficiently, and care about results. You know how to build something from scratch and grow it over time.\n   </ul>\n   <ul>\n    <br>\n   </ul>\n   <ul></ul>\n   <p><strong>WHAT WE OFFER YOU\n     <br></strong></p>\n   <ul>\n    <li>A front-row seat in a fast-scaling, mission-driven startup.</li>\n    <li>Opportunity to set the bar for taste and commercial impact in workplace software.</li>\n    <li>Work with passionate, fun teammates across Belfast, London, Salt Lake City, and beyond.</li>\n    <li>Hybrid working – collaborate from home or from our sleek Belfast city-centre HQ with rooftop terrace, private coffee lounge, and regular wellbeing events.</li>\n    <li>Regular company socials, including an annual off-site where the whole team gets together in person.</li>\n    <li>5 weeks’ vacation per annum (plus public holidays) and a flexible work/life balance.</li>\n    <li>Competitive salary and meaningful stock options.</li>\n    <li>Private healthcare and company pension.</li>\n    <li>Cycle2Work scheme.</li>\n   </ul>\n   <p><strong>HEAR FROM OUR CEO</strong></p>\n   <figure></figure>\n  </div>\n </section>\n <section>\n  <div>\n   <dl>\n    <dt>Department</dt>\n    <dd>\n     <a href="https://careers.kadence.co/departments/product-engineering">Product &amp;

They have committed to ambitious climate goals with no concrete path to achieve them. There are a growing variety of sustainable products and solutions, but evaluating their feasibility is a complex, time-consuming process that requires a lot of expertise. Most experts in the industry don’t have that time to spare. What if you knew for every process design decision what the most sustainable alternative approach was?

Internally, data drives how we serve those clients - from measuring client health and identifying opportunities for deeper engagement, to optimizing our support and implementation processes. Our ability to utilize data at these massive scales is only as powerful as our ability to make it available and actionable across our business and product.</p>\n<p>We're at an inflection point: our data volumes are surging, our product is evolving, and our clients' needs are growing more sophisticated. To power Alloy's next phase of growth, we need a world-class data platform that ensures access to data is fast, simple, and reliable across every team and product feature.</p>\n<p><strong>That’s where you come in!</strong></p>\n<p>We're seeking out the first engineer of our Data Platform team to architect and build Alloy's next-generation data platform from the ground up.

432	<div>\n <p><strong>About Seasats:</strong></p>\n <p>We are a nimble, highly technical business that provides defense, scientific, and commercial customers with maritime robotics solutions. Our primary products are autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) built to carry sensors at sea for months at a time.</p>\n <p>The company is located in sunny San Diego and includes talented engineers, builders, tinkerers, and business architects. Internally, our work culture is hard working but fun. Externally, we’ve built a reputation for being professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated to getting the job done. For more info, check out <a href="http://seasats.com/">seasats.com</a>.</p>\n <p><strong>Role: </strong>Vehicle Robotics Software Engineer</p>\n <p><strong>Location:</strong> San Diego, CA (in-office)</p>\n <p><strong>Salary:</strong><strong> </strong>$120k-150k + stock options, 401k matching, relocation assistance within the U.S. (if applicable), and other benefits.</p>\n <p><strong>Role Overview:</strong></p>\n <p>At Seasats, we're building the future of autonomous ocean vehicles. We’re looking for a developer to join our vehicle software team and help us push the boundaries of what’s possible on the water.</p>\n <p>Our small but fast-moving team is based in San Diego, where we design and implement the onboard software that powers our autonomous surface vessels. Operating in remote, often communications-limited environments, our vehicles rely on a robust autonomy stack and smart sensor integration to carry out persistent missions with minimal human intervention.</p>\n <p>If you're excited by rapid prototyping, hands-on testing, and writing software that directly drives real-world robotic systems, this is a chance to make a big impact in a fast-evolving field.</p>\n <p><strong>About You:</strong></p>\n <p>You like working in small teams and iterating quickly. You keep up on recent developments in software and robotics, and you’ve been known to write code for recreational projects outside of work. You can probably type really fast, or can think so clearly that you don’t need to type fast, or both. Additionally, you have:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>5+ years of experience in the software industry, and 3+ years developing embedded software, ideally for real-time or resource-constrained systems.</li>\n  <li>Proficiency in Python and solid skills in C and/or C++.</li>\n  <li>Worked extensively on software for an embedded Linux target.</li>\n  <li>Handled integration for a variety of sensor data (IMU, GPS, RADAR, LiDAR).</li>\n  <li>Hands-on experience with microcontroller hardware and low-level firmware development.</li>\n  <li>Experience with multi-threaded application development.</li>\n  <li>The ability to conceptualize and implement software architectures that are both reliable and scalable.</li>\n  <li>Excellent collaboration and teamwork skills, with a side of humility.</li>\n  <li>A love for moving fast, but dissatisfaction with things that aren’t robust.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Bonus points if you have:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>A background in mobile robotics — especially familiarity with:\n   <ul>\n    <li>PID control systems</li>\n    <li>Object avoidance</li>\n    <li>Path planning</li>\n    <li>Onboard resource management</li>\n   </ul></li>\n  <li>Familiarity with ROS (or other robotics platform).</li>\n  <li>Experience working on and maintaining large or mature software systems.</li>\n  <li>Experience writing software for a machine capable of destroying itself.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Role Details:</strong></p>\n <p>In this role, you’ll work across the stack, from writing low-level drivers to implementing higher-level decision-making logic. On a day-to-day / week-to-week basis, you will:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Design, implement, and test new features to make our boats smarter, more robust, and easier to use.</li>\n  <li>Develop and validate new autonomy algorithms to safely guide our boats through channels and across oceans.</li>\n  <li>Work hands-on to integrate new sensors and payloads (sometimes at a moment’s notice!).</li>\n  <li>Continuously add to and improve our automated test suite, tooling, and health checks.</li>\n  <li>Support vehicle checkout, testing, troubleshooting, and demonstrations by making trips to our local launch points with a laptop (and potentially to customer sites, if you’re interested in travel) to provide hands-on support.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This is an excellent opportunity to do high impact work, see your code go into live field robotics applications, and join a fun and hard working team on the cutting edge of ocean autonomy. Whether you’re a new grad or a 30 year industry vet, we expect an open-minded learning attitude from everyone at Seasats.</p>\n <p><strong>Life at Seasats:</strong></p>\n <p>Along with your salary, you’ll receive perks including:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Stock options</li>\n  <li>Competitive insurance (including a 99% employer-covered Gold HMO plan or other options)</li>\n  <li>401k matching up to 4% of salary</li>\n  <li>Four free lunches per week</li>\n  <li>An employee activity fund</li>\n  <li>A pet-friendly office</li>\n  <li>Unlimited/Flex PTO</li>\n </ul>\n <p>We’ll help you ramp up and will regularly take time to discuss what’s working and what’s not. We’re also big on personal freedoms: if you’re on top of your responsibilities and want the afternoon off to surf or spend time with friends and family, go for it! We have flexible hours, accommodating PTO, and a personable, high-achieving work culture. We want someone who’s excited to work hard and have fun in this environment.</p>\n <p>Our values are listed below; we’re happy to explain them more during the interview process.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Get Stuff Done</li>\n  <li>Be Kind</li>\n  <li>Fight Entropy</li>\n  <li>Attack with Overwhelming Force</li>\n  <li>Ask More Questions</li>\n  <li>Lines, Not Dots</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Hiring Notes:</strong></p>\n <p>If you decide to apply, you’ll be asked to provide a resume and answer a few screening questions. If we decide to move forward with your application, you can expect no more than 2-3 more rounds of virtual interviews before a final in-person interview. If you have to travel to San Diego, we’ll reimburse pre-approved travel costs.</p>\n <p>Please note that we are currently unable to sponsor employment visas, so candidates must be independently authorized to work in the United States.</p>\n <p>We appreciate diverse perspectives and life experiences, so we encourage women, minorities, and people of all backgrounds to apply.
